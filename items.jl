The Student Government\u2019s legislative structure consists of a body ofundergraduate students (Undergraduate House of Representatives or UHR) and ofa body of graduate students (Graduate Student Senate or GSS). The passing of a\u201cjoint\u201d bill requires consideration of a bill in each body and is subject topassing by an \u201cenactment ratio.\u201d Mostly all financial requests by studentorganizations will be classified as a joint bill. The enactment ratio is amathematical calculation to determine whether a bill passes both bodies ofSGA. It ensures that undergraduate and graduates are representedproportionally since undergraduates represent more of the student body andcontribute more money to SGA from the Student Activity Fee.  The money that SGA allocates to organizations comes from the \u201cStudent ActivityFee\u201d line that shows up on the tuition and fee assessment paid by each studentevery semester. This money is then budgeted to many different organizationswith the Student Center and the Campus Recreation Center receivingapproximately 70% of that budget. At the end of the year, the money that hasnot been spent is placed into several accounts that can then be allocated todifferent groups for special one-time items. Student Government has a set ofpolicies and priorities that it follows with regards to funding requests.  Please keep in mind that SGA has a set amount of money that it can spend inone year. SGA attempts to wisely spend that set of money on the organizationswith most demonstrated need and on those bills that will benefit the majorityof campus. Not every request will end in success.## The ProcessThe process begins with a student organization that needs additional fundingfor an event and turns to SGA for financial assistance. SGA should serve asthe organization\u2019s last resort after all other funding options have beenexhausted. Next, the organization will contact an undergraduate Representativeand a graduate Senator of SGA and ask those members to author their bill. Acomplete list of senators and representatives can be found at<http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/sga_people>. A bill form (further explained in\u201cHow to Submit an SGA Bill\u201d) requesting general information about theorganization or student will be completed and a bill will be drafted toinclude the organization\u2019s idea for an event and an itemized list of requesteditems.  If the bill is submitted and reviewed by the authors by 8am on Monday, thebill will appear in New Business on the agenda at the SGA meeting thatfollowing Tuesday. The Joint Finance Committee (JFC) will review the bill atits weekly meeting that Thursday; a representative from the organization willbe invited to the meeting to speak on behalf of the organization. The JointFinance Committee will suggest changes based on SGA funding policies (a copyof JFC Policy can be found in the back of this binder). The next Tuesday, thebill will move into Old Business where it will be discussed and voted on.After both legislative bodies discuss the bill and the enactment ratio isreached, the funds will be allocated to the organization. Please see thepolicy of the Student Organization Finance Office (in the back of this binder)for information on reimbursements and purchases.Be sure to begin working on bills for events and activities at least four (4)weeks before the event!## Step by Step Process Checklist:  * Before contacting a potential author, draft your bill with itemized costs according to the Joint Finance Committee policy, available at <http://sga.gatech.edu/JFC>.  * Find authors, both an undergraduate and a graduate. A complete list of representatives and senators can be found at <http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/sga_people>. Be sure to include your bill and extra information when making contact.  * Bills must be submitted and reviewed by both authors online by 8am on Monday in order for them to be placed in New Business on Tuesday.  * After appearing in New Business, the bill submitted or a representative from the organization will need to attend a meeting with the Joint Finance Committee (an invitation will be sent to the bill submitter)  * After the meeting with the JFC has been attended and the JFC has made their recommendations, the bill will move to Old Business and be voted on the following week. Note: this is one week after that bill was in New Business.  * You should attend the meeting when your bill appears on the agenda in Old Business. This includes the Graduate Student Senate meeting at 11am on Tuesdays and the Undergraduate House of Representatives meetings at 7pm on Tuesdays, both in the Student Services Building (Flag Building), room 117. You will be asked to present the bill to the body or answer questions from senators/representatives.  * If your bill passes, please see the policy of the Student Organization Finance Office about reimbursements and purchases. It if fails, you will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit.  * [Silver Leaf Certified Organizations](/organizations/silverleaf)  * Organization Category    All CPC Sorority Cultural/Diversity Departmental Sponsored DepartmentsGoverning Boards Honor Society IFC Fraternity Institute Recognized MGC ChapterNone NPHC Chapter Other Production/Performance/PublicationProfessional/Departmental Recreational/Sports/Leisure Religious/SpiritualResidence Hall Association Service/Political/Educational Student GovernmentUmbrellaOrganizationsSearch  * [A](/organizations/index/a)   * [B](/organizations/index/b)   * [C](/organizations/index/c)   * [D](/organizations/index/d)   * [E](/organizations/index/e)   * [F](/organizations/index/f)   * [G](/organizations/index/g)   * [H](/organizations/index/h)   * [I](/organizations/index/i)   * [J](/organizations/index/j)   * [K](/organizations/index/k)   * [L](/organizations/index/l)   * [M](/organizations/index/m)   * [N](/organizations/index/n)   * [O](/organizations/index/o)   * [P](/organizations/index/p)   * [Q](/organizations/index/q)   * [R](/organizations/index/r)   * [S](/organizations/index/s)   * [T](/organizations/index/t)   * [U](/organizations/index/u)   * [V](/organizations/index/v)   * [W](/organizations/index/w)   * [X](/organizations/index/x)   * [Y](/organizations/index/y)   * [Z](/organizations/index/z)   * [ALL](/organizations)| [Name](/organizations/index/sort:NAME/direction:asc) | Description  ---|---|---  ![](/img/44886/logo.jpg) | [3D Politics](/organizations/view/44886) | 3DPolitics is a group dedicated to understanding the opinions of Georgia Tech'sstudents about government and current events.

This slick is at GC600, the site where researchers first noticed theassociation between surface chlorophyll and seepage. The brownish material inthe slick is _Sargassum_, which is abundant in the Gulf and often accumulatesin slicks under calm conditions. (Credit: Joe Montoya, Georgia Tech)[Download Image](/hg/image/489621/original)The oil itself does not appear to help the phytoplankton, but the lowconcentration of oil found above natural seeps isn\u2019t killing them, andturbulence from the rising oil and gas bubbles is bringing up deep-waternutrients that phytoplankton need to grow, according to a study appearingJanuary 25 in the journal _Nature Geoscience_. The result is phytoplanktonconcentrations above oil seeps that are as much as twice the size ofpopulations only a few kilometers away.\u201cThis is the beginning of evidence that some microbes in the Gulf may bepreconditioned to survive with oil, at least at lower concentrations,\u201d saidAjit Subramaniam, an oceanographer at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-DohertyEarth Observatory and co-author of the study. \u201cIn this case, we clearly seethese phytoplankton are not negatively affected at low-concentrations of oil,and there is an accompanying process that helps them thrive. This does notmean that exposure to oil at all concentrations for prolonged lengths of timeis good for phytoplankton.\u201dThe research shows that the effects of oil and gas at the sea surface can bevery different from the impacts of events such as the Deepwater Horizon spill,said [Joseph Montoya](http://www.biology.gatech.edu/people/joseph-montoya), aprofessor in [Georgia Tech\u2019s School ofBiology](http://www.biology.gatech.edu/) and another of the paper\u2019s co-authors. The research could lead to a reconsideration of the response made tospills.\u201cThere may be different responses by different organisms as we look atdifferent regions of the spill itself,\u201d said Montoya.The study is the first to demonstrate this kind of teleconnection between thesea floor, subsea floor and microbial processes in the upper ocean, said AndyJuhl, an aquatic ecologist at Lamont and co-author. It also provides insightinto how microbes and oil interact under water.The researchers, along with colleagues in the Ecosystem Impacts of Oil and GasInputs to the Gulf (ECOGIG) consortium, began studying interactions around oilseeps after the Deepwater Horizon oil well disaster in 2010 to betterunderstand what happens to the oil during catastrophic gushers and to findways to better respond to similar disasters in the future. The natural seeps,found in many parts of the Gulf of Mexico, are tiny compared to an oil wellblowout. An oil slick from a natural seep lasts between one and seven days andreaches between 1 and 100 square kilometers. In comparison, the surface oilfrom the Deepwater Horizon well covered about 11,200 square kilometers andpersisted for months, Subramaniam said. But natural seeps still produce enoughoil and gas that the scientists can smell it at the surface and see the oilbubbles burst.In the lab, Juhl has been conducting experiments to understand how differentconcentrations of oil affect different types of phytoplankton. He has found noamount of oil on its own that has a positive effect on phytoplankton. \u201cThedirect effect of oil is usually negative, but in some cases small amounts ofoil can be outweighed by the positive effect of the nutrients that are taggingalong,\u201d Juhl said.Nigel D\u2019Souza, then a post-doctoral researcher at Lamont, discovered thephytoplankton response to oil seeps while on a ship in the Gulf of Mexicomonitoring chlorophyll fluorescence \u2013 energy that is emitted as light bycompounds inside phytoplankton cells used for photosynthesis. Each time theship crossed over a known oil seep, he noticed a spike in phytoplanktonabundance. It was a Eureka moment, Juhl said. The evidence backed up whatSusan Phan, a co-author and Columbia University student working on her seniorthesis with Subramaniam, had previously noticed in remote sensing data. Thescientists were able to compile multiple lines of evidence through chlorophyllfluorescence, water sampling and satellite images that all supported the ideathat phytoplankton were benefitting from something connected with the seeps,even though the seeps were thousands of feet below.The biggest impact was seen a few hundred feet deep in the water column, atthe point where phytoplankton have enough light from above to still grow, andare receiving the most nutrients rising from below. Over oil seeps, D\u2019Souza \u2013who is now at Georgia Tech \u2013 found that the population was about double theusual amount. The measurements also showed increases in phytoplanktonabundance at the surface.There are still many questions. For example, scientists don\u2019t yet know whichtypes of phytoplankton are thriving over the seeps, or if some types ofphytoplankton in the community are negatively affected by the rising oil.Previous studies have subjected phytoplankton to oil in laboratories to testtheir sensitivity and found differences in the impact on oceanic versuscoastal phytoplankton and differences when phytoplankton were in nutrient-richor nutrient-poor water, as well as damage to some phytoplankton cells atvarious concentrations of oil.The study combined sampling from surface vessels with remote sensing fromspace.\u201cSatellite radar data have given us a detailed picture of where natural seepsare concentrated across deep seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d said co-authorIan MacDonald, an oceanographer and professor at Florida State University.\u201cBuilding on this, the present, novel results show biological effects near theocean surface in areas where seeps are most prolific.\u201dThe research also demonstrates the importance of oceanographic field researchin understanding complex ecosystem issues.\u201cThere has been a tendency to rely on autonomous samplers in place ofresearchers out at sea,\u201d Montoya observed. \u201cFor this project, it was reallyimportant to have diverse groups of scientists with broad interests workingtogether both at sea and onshore, to tease the system apart.\u201dThe research team plans two pathways of study next: To analyze the behavior ofdifferent types of phytoplankton above seeps to better understand how theyinteract with oil, and to improve understanding of how oil from deepunderwater rises to the surface.The study was part of the ECOGIG Consortium, a multi-institutional group thatstudies natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico, funded by the Gulf of MexicoResearch Initiative. In addition to those already mentioned, coauthors on thestudy were Mark Hafez, Alexander Chekalyuk, and Beizhan Yan of Lamont-DohertyEarth Observatory; and Sarah Weber of the Georgia Institute of Technology._This work is supported by The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative's (GOMRI)ECOGIG consortium, with additional support from National Science Foundation(NSF) grant OCE-0928495.

For microorganisms in the oceans \u2013including those that capture half of the carbon taken out of the atmosphereevery day \u2013 viruses are a major threat. But a paper published January 25 inthe journal _Nature Microbiology_ shows that there\u2019s much less certainty aboutthe size of these viral populations than scientists had long believed.[![Virus to microbial cell ratio](http://www.news.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/styles/280_x_scale/public/uploads/mercury_images/ocean-virus2_0.jpg?itok=kZciI6AV)](http://www.news.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/mercury_images/ocean-virus2_0.jpg \"Virus to microbial cell ratio\" )Sometimes the virus to microbial cell (VMR) ratio can be skewed naturallyduring a (for example) burst of viruses from a bacterial cell. Thistransmission electron micrograph from a seawater sample off the southwestcoast of Norway illustrates a high VMR as a result. (Credit: Willie Wilson,Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science)[Download Image](/hg/image/489681/original)Collecting and re-examining more than 5,600 estimates of ocean microbial celland virus populations recorded over the past 25 years, researchers have foundthat viral populations vary dramatically from location to location, and atdiffering depths in the sea. The study highlights another source ofuncertainty governing climate models and other biogeochemical measures.\u201cWhat was surprising was that there was not a constant relationship, as peoplehad assumed, between the number of microbial cells and the number of viruses,\u201dsaid [Joshua Weitz](http://www.biology.gatech.edu/people/joshua-weitz), anassociate professor in the [School of Biology](http://www.biology.gatech.edu/)at the Georgia Institute of Technology and one of the paper\u2019s two senior co-authors. \u201cBecause viruses are parasites, it was assumed that their numberwould vary linearly with the number of microbes. We found that the ratio doesnot remain constant, but decreases systematically as the number of microbesincreases.\u201dThe research, which involved authors from 14 different institutions, wasinitiated as part of a working group from the National Institute forMathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS), which is supported by theNational Science Foundation. The research was completed with additionalsupport from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the Simons Foundation. Theresearch was co-led by Steven Wilhelm, a professor of microbiology at theUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville.In the datasets examined by the researchers, the ratio of viruses to microbesvaried from approximately 1 to 1 and 150 to 1 in surface waters, and from 5 to1 and 75 to 1 in the deeper ocean. For years, scientists had utilized abaseline ratio of 10 to 1 \u2013 ten times more viruses than microbes \u2013 which maynot adequately represent conditions in many marine ecosystems.\u201cA marine environment with 100-fold more viruses than microbes may have verydifferent rates of microbial recycling than an environment with far fewerviruses,\u201d said Weitz. \u201cOur study begins to challenge the notion of a uniformecosystem role for viruses.\u201dA key target for viruses are cyanobacteria \u2013 marine microorganisms that obtaintheir energy through photosynthesis in a process that takes carbon out of theatmosphere. What happens to the carbon these tiny organisms remove may bedetermined by whether they are eaten by larger grazing creatures \u2013 or die fromviral infections.When these cyanobacteria die from infections, their carbon is likely to remainin the top of the water column, where it can nourish other microorganisms. Ifthey are eaten by larger creatures, their carbon is likely to sink into thedeeper ocean as the grazers die or excrete the carbon in in their feces.\u201cViruses have a role in shunting some of the carbon away from the deep oceanand keeping it in the surface ocean,\u201d said Wilhelm. \u201cQuantifying the strengthof the viral shunt remains a vital issue.\u201dInfluenza and measles come to mind when most people think of viruses, but thebulk of world\u2019s viruses actually infect microorganisms. Estimates suggest thata single liter of seawater typically contain more than ten billion viruses.To better understand this population, the researchers conducted a meta-analysis of the microbial and virus abundance data that had been collectedover multiple decades, including datasets collected by many of the co-authorswhose laboratories are based in the United States, Canada and Europe. The datahad been obtained using a variety of techniques, including epifluorescencemicroscopy and flow cytometry.By combining data collected by 11 different research groups, the researcherscreated a big picture from many smaller ones. The statistical relationshipsbetween viruses and microbial cells, analyzed by first-author CharlesWigington from Georgia Tech and second-author Derek Sonderegger from NorthernArizona University, show the range of variation.The available data provides information about the abundance of viralparticles, not their diversity. Viruses are selective in the microbes theytarget, meaning the true rates of infection require a renewed focus on virus-microbe infection networks.\u201cFuture research should focus on examining the relationship between oceanmicroorganisms and viruses at the scale of relevant interactions,\u201d said Weitz,\u201cMore ocean surveys are needed to fill in the many blanks for this criticalpart of the carbon cycle. Indeed, virus infections of microbes could changethe flux of carbon and nutrients on a global scale.\u201d_This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) grantsOCE-1233760 and OCE-1061352, a Career Award at the Scientific Interface fromthe Burroughs Wellcome Fund and a Simons Foundation SCOPE grant.

Support![Georgia Tech police officers pose in front of a police cruisercar](/sites/default/files/images/campus-safety.jpg)  Georgia Tech police on campus.Georgia Institute of Technology Police Department is a fully operational statecertified law enforcement agency devoted to the protection of the campus, itsstudents, faculty, staff and visitors.Through its [Crime PreventionUnit](http://police.gatech.edu/crimeprevention/), GTPD offers a range ofservices to educate students, faculty, and staff, on safety and awareness.Because Georgia Tech is an open, urban campus with many students living insurrounding Atlanta neighborhoods, Georgia Tech takes a very proactive stancewhen it comes to notifying the campus community about safety concerns. Most ofall, GTPD encourages everyone to [be alert andaware](http://police.gatech.edu/crimeprevention/tips/) of surroundings and tobe attentive to the behavior of others both on and off campus.It takes engagement from the entire Georgia Tech community to ensure a safercampus for everyone. If you see suspicious activity, notify GTPD immediatelyat 404-894-2500.## **Safety and Emergency Preparedness**The [Office of EmergencyPreparedness](http://www.police.gatech.edu/emergencypreparedness/) helps theInstitute reduce the effects of disasters through preparedness, response,recovery, and mitigation activities. To assure that ongoing concerns areaddressed, Georgia Tech has an active Emergency Preparedness Advisory Groupthat meets quarterly and includes representatives from key Institutedepartments as well as the Atlanta Police Department (APD), Atlanta FireDepartment (AFD), and the Atlanta/Fulton County Emergency Management Agency(AFCEMA).Emergencies can range from annoyingly inconvenient to completely devastating.To prepare for crisis situations, [EmergencyPreparedness](http://www.police.gatech.edu/emergencypreparedness/) conductsvulnerability assessments across campus and continually reviews preparednessand response procedures to enhance safety.

It's not always easy, butdefining the future never is.Ultimately, Georgia Tech is in the business of creating the next - the nextidea, the next technology, and the next legion of open, agile minds. Boundtogether with passion and skill, spurred by our imaginations, and rolling upour sleeves to get it done, we focus on solving the grand challenges of ourtime.#### Working Together:We're unbound by silos, limitations, expectations, or stereotypes, which makesit possible for us to embrace fresh perspectives and frees us to be bold anddaring as we seek new answers.* * *###### ![](/sites/default/files/news/Creating%20the%20Next-Prausnitz.jpg)  **Mark Prausnitz**_Love Family Professor in Chemical and Biomedical Engineering; Director,Center for Drug Design, Development and Delivery _Mark Prausnitz created the next technology to administer vaccines worldwide.Developed in partnership with the CDC and Emory University, microneedlepatches are showing great promise for fighting measles, polio, flu, and othervaccine-preventable diseases, with greater ease of storage, distribution, anddisposal compared to conventional vaccines.* * *###### ![](/sites/default/files/news/Creating%20the%20Next_Lam.jpg)  **Wilbur Lam**_Wallace H.

Georgia School of Technology opened its doors inOctober 1888 to 84 students.![The Ramblin Wreck in front of Tech Tower](/sites/default/files/images/Tech-tower-wreck.jpg)The School's creation signaled the beginning of the transformation of theagrarian South to an industrial economy.During its first 50 years, Tech grew from a narrowly focused trade school to aregionally recognized technological university.In 1948, the School's name was changed to the Georgia Institute of Technologyto reflect a growing focus on advanced technological and scientific research.Women students were admitted in 1952, and in 1961 Georgia Tech became thefirst university in the Deep South to admit African-American students withouta court order.In recent years, Georgia Tech has been a national leader in managing theglobal transition from an industrial economy to an information economy.Throughout its long history, Georgia Tech has always focused its efforts onpreparing students to use their innovative skills and strong work ethic tosolve real-world problems and improve the lives of people around the globe.From the world-famous \"Ramblin' Wreck\" fight song to the fun and festivitiesof RATS Week, the Tech campus is steeped in time-honored traditions thatstudents embrace from generation to generation.#### Tech Traditions##### BuzzBuzz -- who made his first campus appearance in 1980 -- is the world-famousand beloved mascot of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Buzz gets Tech fanscheering at nearly all the Institute's intercollegiate sporting events.* * *##### Ramblin' Wreck Fight SongThe words and music for Tech's world-famous \"Ramblin' Wreck\" fight song wereinspired by an old folk ballad, \"The Sons of the Gamboliers.\" The nameRamblin' Wreck gained widespread acceptance in the 1920s, when Tech graduatesbegan building makeshift mechanical buggies to improve a poor transportationsystem in South America.* * *##### Ramblin' Wreck Model-A FordThe 1930 Model A Ford was donated to Georgia Tech in 1961 by Capt. TedJohnson, a then-retired pilot who had purchased and restored the car for hisson. The official Ramblin' Wreck appears on the field at all home footballgames and other events as a symbol of Georgia Tech.\u200b A second Model A waspurchased and restored by the Alumni Association in the 1980s, and is used atalumni events. A third automobile was purchased and restored by the GeorgiaTech Foundation, and is parked in the lobby of the Georgia Tech Hotel.* * *##### RATS WeekRATS (Recently Acquired Tech Students) Week is Tech's orientation week for newstudents, when freshmen learn all about Tech campus traditions.* * *##### The WhistleBelieved to have come to Tech in 1896, the steam whistle was meant to mimicthe industrial whistles of the times. It called the students to their shopclasses. Today, it is operated by a computerized atomic clock that releasesthe steam. The Whistle blows five minutes to the hour to end classes onMondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. It has a different schedule on Tuesdays andThursdays. It also blows after Tech touchdowns during home games.[Learn More about Georgia Tech's History andTraditions](http://livinghistory.gatech.edu/new/)#### Georgia Tech Resources  * [Offices &amp; Departments](http://www.gatech.edu/offices-and-departments)  * [News Center](http://www.news.gatech.edu)  * [Campus Calendar](http://www.gatech.edu/calendar)  * [Special Events](http://www.specialevents.gatech.edu)  * [GreenBuzz](http://www.greenbuzz.gatech.edu)  * [Institute Communications](http://www.comm.gatech.edu)  * Visitor Resources  * [Campus Visits](http://www.admission.gatech.edu/visit)  * [Directions to Campus](http://www.admission.gatech.edu/visit/directions-and-parking)  * [Visitor Parking Information](http://www.pts.gatech.edu/visitors/Pages/default.aspx)  * [GTvisitor Wireless Network Information](http://www.lawn.gatech.edu/help/GTvisitor.html)  * [Georgia Tech Global Learning Center](https://pe.gatech.edu/global-learning-center/)  * [Georgia Tech Hotel &amp; Conference Center](http://www.gatechhotel.com)  * [Barnes &amp; Noble at Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.bncollege.com)  * [Ferst Center for the Arts](http://www.ferstcenter.gatech.edu)  * [Robert C.
